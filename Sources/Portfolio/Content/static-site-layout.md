title: Static Site: Layout and section patterns

## Layout as a first-class component
The site uses layout components for headers, footers, and page structure. This keeps the HTML predictable and reduces repeated markup.

## Section-driven pages
Pages are composed from sections and cards, making it easy to build new layouts without rewriting grid logic. This also keeps the design system consistent.

## Practical benefit
When the layout is centralized, design tweaks happen once and propagate everywhere. The site stays cohesive even as new content is added.
