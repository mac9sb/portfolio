title: Release Automation: Predictable GitHub workflows
date: January 9, 2026

## Releases that stay predictable
Each subproject includes a small workflow that handles release tasks. This keeps deployments consistent across apps and static sites.

## Why it helps
Automated releases reduce manual errors and keep versioning consistent. The workflow is the single place to review how artifacts are produced.

## Minimalism wins
Workflows should do only what is needed: build, test, and publish. Anything more becomes hard to debug and harder to trust.
