title: Shared Design System: Cross-platform consistency
date: January 2, 2026
---

## Why a shared layer
The shared module contains design utilities that define spacing, typography, and other conventions. This keeps the UI consistent across iOS, macOS, watchOS, and the web.

## Benefits for the static site
Static pages match the app experience because they pull from the same visual language. This matters for brand cohesion.

## Practice to keep
Document design choices in code. It makes the system easier to evolve and reduces accidental drift.
